# Simple Looper

Simple looper for the Daisy platform.

This looper was adapted for the Daisy pod based on the original code by VLADYSLAV LYTVYNENKO here: https://github.com/Synthux-Academy/simple-examples/tree/main/daisyduino/simple-looper.

## Adaptations:

1. Updated control mappings for Daisy pod
2. Updated button handling behaviour for Daisy pod buttons
3. Button 2 clears the buffer
4. One channel is clean with no pitch shifting, the other has pitch-shifting and chorus - it sounds wild!

## Controls:

- Button 1: Hold to record, release to stop
- Button 2: Clear record buffer
- Pot 1: Loop start position
- Pot 2: Loop length
- Encoder Turn: Pitch
- Encoder Press: Reset pitch
